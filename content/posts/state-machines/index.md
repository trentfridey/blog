## <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Statecharts: an Extension to State Machines {#statecharts-an-extension-to-state-machines}

Statecharts are a group of extensions to state machines, that augment the features of state machines to make them easier to model.
These areas include hierarchy, concurrency, and communication.
Namely, in statecharts, you can have:

-   Hierarchical states
-   Orthogonal states
-   History states

or

statecharts = state-diagrams + depth +
