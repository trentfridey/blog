The Net Promoter Score can be considered as a statistic measuring population differences:

$$
NPS = p_{\text{promoters}} - p_{\text{demoters}}
$$

If we give one survey, what is the probability that we will have an NPS of 0.3?

Well, considering that if we take a large enough survey, the NPS estimator:

$$
\hat{NPS} = \hat{p}_{\text{promoters}} - \hat{p}_{\text{demoters}}
$$

is normally distributed, with $E[\hat{NPS}] = NPS$ and $V[\hat{NPS}] = $
