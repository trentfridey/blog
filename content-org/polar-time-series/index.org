Let $R$ be a random Rayleigh-distributed variable.
Let $\phi$ be a random uniformly-distributed variable.

The time series defined by:

\[
Y_t = R\cos{(2\pi(ft + \phi))} 
\]

with $t\in\mathbb{Z}$, is equivalent to the time series

\[
Y_t' = U + V  
\]

if $U$ and $V$ are independently distributed standard normal variables:

\[
U, V \sim N(0,1)
\]

Equivalence in this context means that $Y_t$ and $Y'_t$ have the same PMFs.

* Proof

** Distribution of Cosine
  
  The PDF of $\cos(2\pi(ft + \phi))$ can be derived from the PDF of $\phi$ using the rule for functions of a random variable:
  For a random variable $X$ with PDF $f$, and an invertible function $Y(X)$, the PDF $g$ of $Y$ is given by:

  \[
  g(y) = f(x(y))\left|\frac{d x}{d y}\right|
  \]

  In the case that $Y = \cos(2\pi(ft + \phi))$ and $f$ is the uniform distribution, we get:

\[
  g(y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-y^2}}
\]
  
With this, we can calculate the PMF of $Y$ in terms of $\phi$: 

\[
\text{Pr}(g(Y)) = \int g(y) dy
\]
\[
= \int\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-y^2}} dy
\]

\[
=\int\frac{\sin(2\pi(ft+\phi))}{2\pi\sqrt{1-\cos^2(2\pi(ft + \phi))}}d\phi
\]

\[
=\int \frac{d\phi}{2\pi}
\]

In other words

\[
\phi \sim U(0,1) \implies \cos(2\pi(ft + \phi)) \sim U(0,2\pi)
\]

** Equivalence of Series

The PMF of $Y_t$ can be expressed as a product, since $R$ and $\phi$ are independent:

\[
\text{Pr}(R\cos(2\pi(ft + \phi))) = \text{Pr}(R)\text{Pr}(\cos(2\pi(ft + \phi)))
\]

\[
= \int r e^{-r^2/2} dr \int \frac{1}{2\pi} d\phi
\]


\[
= \frac{1}{2\pi}\iint r e^{-r^2/2} dr d\phi
\]

Change our variables of integration:

\[
u = r\cos(\phi), \qquad v = r\sin(\phi)
\]

Then we can write:
\[
\text{Pr}(R\cos(2\pi(ft + \phi))) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\iint e^{-(u^2+v^2)/2} du dv
\]

  Which is the PMF of the time series defined by $Y_t' = U + V$. $\square$
