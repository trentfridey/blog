Picking up from last [[https://blog.trentfridey.com/gsoc-1][week]], this week I focused on establishing a build environment for the QuTiP Virtual Lab application.
Although this may seem tangential to the actual application, it will allow future contributors to build the application regardless of their platform (Windows, Mac, Linux).

The way to do this is by specifying a container for building the application via a ~Dockerfile~.
Then, anyone with the source code and ~docker~ installed should be able to build the application.

The steps for building the application are:

1. Install all the required binaries, configurations, and build tools, including Python.
2. Create a virtual environment with ~micromamba~ based on the QuTiP package and its dependencies.
3. Pack the environment using ~empack~ and compile a WebAssembly module with ~emscripten-32~.


Fortunately, ~micromamba~ provides a [[https://hub.docker.com/r/mambaorg/micromamba][base image]] with ~micromamba~ installed.
The link also details how to set up a virtual environment.
For our application, we set up two virtual environments:

1. ~base~: includes ~empack~ and its dependencies. Specified with ~build-environment.yaml~.
2. ~web~: includes ~qutip~ and its dependencies, for compilation with ~emscripten-32~. Specified with ~web-environment.yaml~.

To complete step (3), we just activate the ~base~ environment and tell Docker to run ~empack~ to pack the ~web~ environment.

* Running the Application in a React App

  Once the task of compiling QuTiP to WebAssembly was taken care of, I turned to running the task of running the WebAssembly in a React application.

** Webpack Woes
  
  Getting React to run in the browser requires ~webpack~, which pulls in all of the Javascript dependencies and produces a single bundle that a web page can run.
  I added a ~webpack.config.js~ file to do this, and added a configuration for including the WebAssembly created from ~docker~ in the previous step in the bundle.
  With this configuration in place, I added a few scripts to the project to run both ~docker~ and ~webpack~, and then start a development server with the output.
  However, when I first did this, I was greeted with an error from ~webpack~.

As it turns out, the ~pyjs~ Javascript runtime had used the word `package` as a variable name, and according to [[https://mdn.org][MDN]], `package` is a future reserved keyword.

Although a proper fix would require editing the ~pyjs~ source code (which is a problem because it is an external package), we can just patch the offending file by doing a =Find + Replace=.

After renaming the variable, it was revealed that this was the only issue preventing the application from starting, so I made a note to properly fix this issue, and continued on to developing the user interface.

** First Pass at a User Interface

   I had made a sketch of what the user interface could look like as a part of the proposal, so I took that as my starting point.

   The sketch featured three panes: a "lab" where the user could drag-and-drop qubits and draw interactions between them; a "details" pane where the user could see the lab configuration described in terms of equations -- with a large "simulate" button; and a "results" pane where the user could see the results of the simulation, in terms of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere][Bloch spheres]] and time-evolution plots.
   
   The mentors and I had decided to try to get the second two panes working before trying to add the first, so I started by adding the ~katex~ package to render equations in the browser and ~Three.js~ for rendering the Bloch spheres.
   After re-running ~webpack~ with the new dependencies and writing some code for rendering a simple sphere, I was able to get a proof-of-concept UI working:

* Next steps
  
  Pressing the **Simulate** button doesn't do much at this point, so the app is quite working yet.
  Also, at this point, the code for running QuTiP is not cached on the client, which means pressing the button will be slow.
  Finally, we need a better way than =Find + Replace= to patch the ~pyjs~ runtime.
  Next week, I will be focusing on fixing these issues.
