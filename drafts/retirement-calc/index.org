Here's a simple model of retirement planning based on the basic principle: as long as returns from investments are greater than expenses, working for pay is not necessary.
Whether you can realize the returns (and consistently) is a different matter, but let's consider a simple model where we assume we do have such returns.

* Derivation

Assume the following values are constant:

  - Savings rate $S$ is the dollar amount put into investments each month
  - Interest rate $r$ is the percent increase in value of investments given for a month
  - Existing capital $P_0$ is the amount of money that is initial invested

  After $t$ months, the capital will appreciate to:

  \[
  P(t) = P_0(1+r)^t + \sum_{k=1}^t S(1+r)^{t-k}
  \]

  So that the return after $t$ months is $R(t) = P(t) - P(t-1)$

  \[
  R(t)
  = P_{0}r(1+r)^{t-1} + S\left(1+r\sum_{k=1}^{t-1}(1+r)^{t-k-1}\right)
  \]
  
Of course, in retirement, you stop making contributions, so that the full definition is:

\[
R(t) = \begin{cases}
= P_{0}r(1+r)^{t-1} + S\left(1+r\sum_{k=1}^{t-1}(1+r)^{t-k-1}\right), & t < t^* \\
= P_{0}r(1+r)^{t-1}+ S\left(1+r\sum_{k=1}^{t^*-1}(1+r)^{t-k-1}\right), & t \geq t^*
\end{cases}
  \]

    What is interesting is if we allow for the savings rate to increase with time -- where we make a 5% increase in our savings rate year over year.

    #+CAPTION: In this plot, we can see that a 5% yearly increase in the savings amount for the case of a 6% interest rate, the returns approximate the same curve for the 10% interest rate with no increasing savings rate.

* Conclusion

  In this post we explored the simple math behind retirement planning, and found that a lower interest rate can approximate the growth of a higher interest rate by increasing the savings rate year over year.
